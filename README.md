# Alarm_Clock_with_GUI_Using_Python

First, letâ€™s check the steps to build an Alarm Clock program in Python:

- Importing all the libraries and modules required
- Putting forward a while loop which takes the argument of the time, the user wants to set the alarm on and automatically breaks when the time is up, with sound
- Create a display window for user input.

## 1. First, we import all the necessary libraries and modules:
```
#Importing all the necessary libraries to form the alarm clock
from tkinter import * 
import datetime 
import time 
import winsound 
 ```
